## Algonive_Task_Manager

A web-based task management system developed during my internship at **Algonive**, designed to help users efficiently organize and track their tasks.  
This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks with deadlines, all within a clean and responsive interface.

- **Mark as Complete/Incomplete** – Track progress and manage task status.
- **Filter Tasks** – View all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.
- **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are saved in **Local Storage**, so they remain even after closing the browser.

- **Responsive UI** – Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
